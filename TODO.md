# TODO

## Minor
1. Prevent duplicate entries
2. If no input has `autocomplete` but there is still a form present, fall back

3. Make detection happen upon form submission instead of page load
4. Add other user info (e.g., name, phone number)

## Major
1. Landing page
2. Selecting threat model
3. Pretty graph in settings page
